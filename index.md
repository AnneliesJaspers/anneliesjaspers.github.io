## Welcome to Annelies's website

Hi! I am Annelies. 

In 2017, I finished my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Leuven in Belgium and the university of Copenhagen in Denmar. I specialised in Algebraic Geometry and you can find my PhD thesis [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.07086.pdf).

After my PhD, I started as a consultant at [Addestino Innovation Managent](https://www.addestino.be/) in Belgium. Addestino is a boutique management consulting firm focused on innovation and projects for a conmpany's IT department or CIO. I for example advised a governmental institution about innovating by developing an app.

I moved to London in September 2018, and unfortunately, this meant I had to leave Addestino. I started as a research analyst at [Howe Robinson Partners](https://www.howerobinson.com/), a shipbroking company.
