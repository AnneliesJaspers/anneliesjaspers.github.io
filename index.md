## Welcome to Annelies's website

Hi! I am Annelies. 

In 2017, I finished my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Leuven in Belgium and the university of Copenhagen in Denmar. I specialised in Algebraic Geometry and you can find my PhD thesis [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.07086.pdf).

After my PhD, I started at [Addestino Innovation Managent](https://www.addestino.be/) in Belgium as a consultant.
