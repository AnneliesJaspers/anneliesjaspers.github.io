## Hi! I am Annelies. 

I am a mathematician passionate about analytics and travel. I will write about my adventures (in my two passions) here. Coming soon!

### About me professionally

In 2017, I finished my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Leuven in Belgium and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. I specialised in Algebraic Geometry and you can find my PhD thesis [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.07086.pdf).

After my PhD, I started as a consultant at [Addestino Innovation Managent](https://www.addestino.be/) in Belgium. Addestino is a boutique management consulting firm focused on innovation and strategy projects for IT departments. For example, I advised a governmental institution about innovating by developing an app.

I moved to London in September 2018, and unfortunately, this meant I had to leave Addestino. But this also meant I had the opportunity to start as a research analyst at [Howe Robinson Partners](https://www.howerobinson.com/), a shipbroking company. Howe Robinson hired me to further develop their research in a more "data intelligent" way.
